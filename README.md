# TS_DragNDrop
Simple Drag and Drop project using TypeScript

I made this simple project to learn advanced types in TypeScript and to learn about handling events and state without external frameworks.

Here you can see the live preview: https://icarlogiovanni.github.io/TS_DragNDrop/

1) Add a new project. 'Description' must be >5 char long and 'People' accepts numbers between 0 and 10
2) Once your project is added, you can drag and drop its card to the 'finished projects' section and viceversa.

Works on mobile and desktop!
